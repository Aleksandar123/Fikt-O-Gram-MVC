# Fikt-O-Gram-MVC

Fikt-O-gram is a webapp I build for my graduation assignment where I used the technologies
from above to build a clone of the popular social network Instagram. The assignement
is seperated into two parts. In the first part I used Spring MVC for the back end of the
application along side with PostgreSQL as database, Hibernate for ORM, Spring JPA for the relations, Hazelcast for
caching and Thymeleaf for the view as Java template engine.
